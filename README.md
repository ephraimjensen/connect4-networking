# To get things working before I'm finished: 

  - change HOST to your local IP
  - change PORT to a port that you have open
  - maybe something else. Good Luck

# Things TO BE DONE (CORE):
 - make one player actionable at a time
 - write algorithm to check for a 4-in-a-row. (either around last placed or scan whole grid)

## Wants: 
 - only allow to place in non-full column (client side probably)
 - keep both clients on the same page better (maybe if a change is made, send updates to both clients)
 - make the display/ UI better
 - better input verification
 - maybe try to make sends/recieves non-blocking and more dynamic
 - maybe rewrite code according to a pattern of sends and recieves
